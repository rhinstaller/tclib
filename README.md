tclib
=====

A python library for managing test cases, test plans, and requirements stored in yaml files.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is just a temporary clone of the tclib repo for a smooth transition, as the project has been renamed to [rhinstaller/tplib](https://github.com/rhinstaller/tplib). You probably want to use the tplib repository instead.
